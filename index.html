             <h>What is COVID 19?</h>
            <p>
                The first case of COVID-19 was reported Dec. 1, 2019, and the cause was a then-new coronavirus later named SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 may have originated in an animal and changed (mutated) so it could cause illness in humans. In the past, several infectious disease outbreaks have been traced to viruses originating in birds, pigs, bats and other animals that mutated to become dangerous to humans. Research continues, and more study may reveal how and why the coronavirus evolved to cause pandemic disease.
            </p>
            <p>
                As of now, researchers know that the coronavirus is spread through droplets and virus particles released into the air when an infected person breathes, talks, laughs, sings, coughs or sneezes. Larger droplets may fall to the ground in a few seconds, but tiny infectious particles can linger in the air and accumulate in indoor places, especially where many people are gathered and there is poor ventilation. This is why mask-wearing, hand hygiene and physical distancing are essential to preventing COVID-19.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h>Symptoms-what are the main symptoms and next steps
                </h>
                <ul>
                    <li>a high temperature – this means you feel hot to touch on your chest or back (you do not need to measure your temperature)</li>
                    <li>a new, continuous cough – this means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or 3 or more coughing episodes in 24 hours (if you usually have a cough, it may be worse than usual)
                    </li>
                    <li>a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste – this means you've noticed you cannot smell or taste anything, or things smell or taste different to normal</li>
                  </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                About 1 in 3 people with COVID-19 do not have symptoms but can still infect others.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h>What to do if you notice symptoms?</h>
            </p>
            <p>Stay home. Most people with COVID-19 have mild illness and can recover at home without medical care. Do not leave your home, except to get medical care. Do not visit public areas.
                Take care of yourself. Get rest and stay hydrated. Take over-the-counter medicines, such as acetaminophen, to help you feel better.
                Stay in touch with your doctor. Call before you get medical care. Be sure to get care if you have trouble breathing, or have any other emergency warning signs, or if you think it is an emergency.
                Avoid public transportation, ride-sharing, or taxis.

                </h>
            </p>
            <p>
                Contact your healthcare provider. Book on the NHS website 
                <a href="url">https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                You can get a PCR test if you have symptoms of COVID-19 or a rapid lateral flow test if you do NOT have any symptoms.</p>
            <p>
               <h>Self isolating & treating symptoms</h> 
               Self-isolation is when you do not leave your home because you have or might have coronavirus (COVID-19). This is done to stop the virus from spreading to other people.
            </p>
            <p><h>When to self isolate:</h>
            </p>
            <p><ul>
                <li>You have any symptoms of COVID-19 (a high temperature, a new, continuous cough or a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste)</li>
                <li>You've tested positive for COVID-19 – this means you have the virus</li>
                <li>someone you live with has symptoms or tested positive</li>
                <li>Someone in your childcare or support bubble has symptoms and you’ve been in close contact with them since their symptoms started or during the 48 hours before they started</li>
                <li>Someone in your childcare or support bubble tested positive and you’ve been in close contact with them since they had the test or in the 48 hours before their test
                </li>
                <li>You've been told you've been in contact with someone who tested positive</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p><h>How to treat symptoms at home:</h>
            </p>
            <p><ul>
                <li>Drink plenty of fluids. Drink enough water so that your pee is a pale, clear colour.</li>
                <li>Avoid alcohol as this will make you more dehydrated. There is also evidence that people with COVID-19 infection are prone to liver damage, which can be worsened by drinking alcohol.</li>
                <li>Get plenty of rest. You should isolate yourself at home if you have any symptoms of coronavirus, and avoid any strenuous activity whilst you are unwell.</li>
                <li>Use over-the-counter medicines to treat some of your symptoms.</li>
              </ul>

        <h2>Vaccinations</h2>
        <article>
            <p>
              The coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine is safe and effective. It gives you the best protection against COVID-19. The Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines are currently available in the UK.
            </p>
            <h3> How safe is the COVID-19 vaccine? </h3>
            <p>
              The vaccines approved for use in the UK have met strict standards of safety, quality and effectiveness set out by the independent Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).
            </p>
            <p>
              Any COVID-19 vaccine that is approved must go through all the clinical trials and safety checks all other licensed medicines go through. The MHRA follows international standards of safety.
            </p>
            <p>
            Other vaccines are being developed and they will only be available on the NHS once they have been thoroughly tested to make sure they are safe and effective.
            </p>
            <p>
              So far, millions of people have been given a COVID-19 vaccine and reports of serious side effects, such as allergic reactions or clotting problems, have been very rare.
            </p>

            <h3> Who is eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine?</h3>
          </p>
          <p>
            The NHS is currently offering the COVID-19 vaccine to people most at risk.
          </p>
          <p>It's being given to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>people aged 32 and over</li>
            <li>people who will turn 32 before 1 July 2021</li>
            <li>people at high risk from COVID-19 (clinically extremely vulnerable)</li>
            <li>people who live or work in care homes</li>
            <li>health and social care workers</li>
            <li>people with a condition that puts them at higher risk (clinically vulnerable)</li>
            <li>people with a learning disability</li>
            <li>people who are a main carer for someone at high risk from COVID-19</li>
          </ul>
            
          <p>
            For further information as to whether if you qualify as ‘high risk’, please <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/people-at-higher-risk/who-is-at-high-risk-from-coronavirus-clinically-extremely-vulnerable/" target="_blank">click here</a> for guidance from the NHS.
          </p>

          </p>
          
          <p>
            If you are not eligible yet, wait to be contacted. The NHS will let you know when it's your turn to have the COVID-19 vaccine.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <p>
            <h3>How is it administered?</h3>
          </p>
          <p>
            The COVID-19 vaccine is given as an injection into your upper arm.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's given as 2 doses. You will have the second dose 3 to 12 weeks after having the first dose. Both doses will be of the same vaccine. 
          </p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <p>
            <h3>What are the side effects?</h3>
          </p>
          <p>
            Most side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine are mild and should not last longer than a week, such as:
            <ul>
              <li>a sore arm where the needle went in</li>
              <li>feeling tired</li>
              <li>a headache</li>
              <li>feeling achy</li>
              <li>feeling or being sick</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            You can take painkillers, such as paracetamol, if you need to.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may get a high temperature or feel hot or shivery 1 or 2 days after having your vaccination. But if you have a high temperature that lasts longer than 2 days, a new, continuous cough or a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste you may have COVID-19. Stay at home and get a test.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your symptoms get worse or you are worried, please call 111.
          </p>
          <p>
            <h4>Allergic reactions</h4>
          </p>
          <p>
            Tell healthcare staff before you are vaccinated if you've ever had a serious allergic reaction. You should not have the COVID-19 vaccine if you have ever had a serious allergic reaction (including anaphylaxis) to:
          <ul>
            <li>a previous dose of the same vaccine</li>
            <li>any of the ingredients in the vaccine</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            Serious allergic reactions are rare. If you do have a reaction to the vaccine, it usually happens in minutes. Staff giving the vaccine are trained to deal with allergic reactions and treat them immediately.
          </p>
          <p>
            <h4>Reports of extremely rare blood clots</h4>
          </p>
          <p>
            The MHRA is carrying out a detailed review of reports of an extremely rare blood clotting problem affecting a small number of people who have had the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine.
          </p>
          <p>
            The problem can also happen in people who have not been vaccinated and it's not yet clear why it affects some people.
          </p>
          <p>
            The COVID-19 vaccine can help stop you getting seriously ill or dying from COVID-19. For people aged 40 or over and those with other health conditions, the benefits of being vaccinated with the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine outweigh any risk of clotting problems.

          <p>
            For people under 40 without other health conditions, it's currently advised that it's preferable to have another COVID-19 vaccine instead of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine.
          </p>
          <p>
            Call 111 immediately if you get any of these symptoms starting from around 4 days to 4 weeks after being vaccinated:
            <ul>
             <li>a severe headache that is not relieved with painkillers or is getting worse</li>
            <li>a headache that feels worse when you lie down or bend over</li>
              <li>a headache that's unusual for you and occurs with blurred vision, feeling or being sick, problems speaking, weakness, drowsiness or seizures (fits)</li>
              <li>a rash that looks like small bruises or bleeding under the skin</li>
              <li>shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling or persistent abdominal (tummy) pain</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How effective is the COVID-19 vaccine?</h3>
          </p>
          <p>
            The first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine should give you good protection from COVID-19 from 3 or 4 weeks after you've had it. However, you need to have the 2 doses of the vaccine to give you longer lasting protection.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can still get or spread COVID-19 even if you have the vaccine, therefore it is important to:
            <ul>
              <li>continue to follow social distancing guidance</li>
              <li>if you can, wear something that covers your nose and mouth in places where it's hard to stay away from other people</li>
            </ul>

      <h3>Things to look forward to</h3>
       <h2>Social distancing & changes to everyday life</h2>
       <p>Social distancing, also called “physical distancing,” means keeping a safe space between yourself and other people who are not from your household.
          </p>
        <p>To practice social or physical distancing, stay at least 2 metres (about 2 arm lengths) from other people who are not from your household in both indoor and outdoor spaces.
       </p>
       <p>Social distancing should be practiced in combination with other everyday preventive actions to reduce the spread of COVID-19, including wearing masks, avoiding touching your face with unwashed hands, and frequently washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
       </p>
       <p>
         <h2>How has lockdown changed in England from 17 May?
         </h2>
       </p>

          <h4>Travel </h4>
      </p>
      <p>
          International travel from England is now completely legal, but strict border controls remain in place. Different rules apply for those arriving in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is currently a new ‘traffic light’ system that came into force on May 17th, that sets out clearly different testing and self-isolation requirements for people entering England.
     </p>
     <p>
         As the virus is still spreading in many parts of the world, people should not be travelling to amber or red countries.
     </p>
     <p>
        Given the need for caution, the green list will initially be modest with only the following 12 countries and territories on the initial list when international travel resumes on 17 May:
     </p>
     <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Portugal (including the Azores and Madeira)</li>
            <li>Israel and Jerusalem</li>
            <li>Gibraltar</li>
            <li>Iceland</li>
            <li>Singapore</li>
            <li>Australia</li>
            <li>Brunei Darussalam</li>
            <li>Falkland Islands</li>
            <li>New Zealand</li>
            <li>Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha</li>
            <li>South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
     <p>
         Countries on the green list pose the lowest risk, therefore passengers who have only visited or transited through a green list country will not be required to quarantine on arrival in England. They will be required to fill in the passenger locator form, provide a valid notification of a negative test result prior to travel and take a sequencing test on day 2 after arrival.
     </p>
     <p>
        The Maldives, Nepal and Turkey will be added to the red list from 4am on 12 May, a sign of our ongoing vigilance in protecting against the virus and from the importation of variants. International visitors who have visited or transited through any red list country in the previous 10 days will be refused entry into England. Only British and Irish citizens, or those with residence rights in the UK, will be allowed to enter and they must stay in a government approved quarantine facility for 10 days.
    </p>
     <p>
        All other countries will remain on the amber list. Passengers who have visited or transited through an amber country will be required to fill in the passenger locator form, provide a valid notification of a negative test result prior to travel, quarantine at home for 10 days, and take a test on day 2 and day 8 after arrival. Passengers will also have the option to opt into Test to Release at day 5.
    </p>
     <p>
        The risk posed by individual countries will be continuously monitored and the green, amber and red lists will be updated regularly. The Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC) will produce risk assessments of countries and territories. Decisions will be taken by ministers, who take into account the JBC risk assessments, alongside wider public health factors.
    </p>
    <p>
        A summary of the JBC methodology has been published on GOV.UK, alongside key data that supports ministers’ decisions.
